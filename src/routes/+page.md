features:
  - title: Message gardening
    description: What starts as an ephemeral chat message might evolve into an intricate thread with multiple incoming/outgoing connections. Commune facilitates this progression by making chat-view and board-view two different view modes of the one same channel.
  - title: Web-public chat
    description: Make your digital village gate-less, so new visitors may freely look around before making themselves known. Grant informative threads a proper place on the indexable web.
      
  - title: Webrings & common channels (soon)
    description: Your friends are just a click away, discoverable through Related Space lists. Better yet, closely aligned communities can carry common channels together, e.g. syndicating a single offtopic channel across multiple spaces.
  - title: Fediverse integration (soon)
    description: While the Matrix network is its own federated system, Commune also connects with the larger fediverse, i.e. Mastodon, Lemmy et.al. Log in with your fediverse account, verify links and more.
  - title: Discord sync (soon)
    description: Already got a community on Discord? No worries, we'll sync it up for you, and suddenly your Discord server will be fully backed up and web-readable via its Commune bridge.
  
  - title: Incremental Encryption (soon)
    description: Avoid the complexities of encryption in the nascent stages of community. Opt-in to the advanced security features of Matrix when the time is right.

  - title: Bringing web 1.0 back
    description: In the glory days of web 1.0, websites would prominently link to other, similar places via lists known as 'forum affiliates', 'blogrolls' or 'webrings'. It was a time of greater connectivity between communal web spaces, each serving as a portal to a tightly knit but infinitely expansive hinterland of digital villages. Our intention is to bring back the good vibes of the old neighborhoods. Not by reressing to a bygone era, but by building the web 1.Â½ that was skipped over.

  - title: Protocol-centric software
    description: We're building Commune on top of the Matrix protocol, extending it with community features.
      Whereas Matrix is private-first, Commune is public-first.
      Commune is a full-stack app, but as a client it can (soon!) interact with any Matrix server.
      Commune instances can in turn be viewed by any Matrix client; it's all federated. Some features however can only be accessed via the Commune client.
